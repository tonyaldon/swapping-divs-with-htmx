# Swapping divs with https://htmx.org

Just start a static web server in the repository.  For instance, if
you use `browser-sync` you can run the following command and start
playing with `htmx` by modifying the index files:

    git clone https://github.com/tonyaldon/swapping-divs-with-htmx
    browser-sync start -s -w --files "*"

If you are an Emacs Lisp programmers you can check `index.el` file
which has been used to generate the index files in that repository.
